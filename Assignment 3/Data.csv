The Session was attended by 50 students. Mr. Bibhu highlighted the Heptagon of exponential growth. There are seven major elements to growth at a constant proportion an exponential growth. One of the major one beings to have a guide or a guru in your life. There needs to be a pallbearer who shows the results and the consequences. It is said Experience speaks much louder than effort does. The second one is to Acquire wisdom faster than it's too late. For growth all the loopholes and advantages have to be known before it's all gone in a snap. Things change faster in the business world than anywhere else. Years of hard work and success can be lost even due to a lack of wisdom. It's important to Respect everything when you have it. Maybe the next second it all goes away and a person is left with nothing else but regret. Growth happens when there is a desire to achieve more at every step. Thus it's natural to Stay hungry stay foolish. Anything and Everything can be done if we Activate our subconscious mind and awaken the giant within. It's all about what we think and how we want to create it. Our mind is the most powerful tool that can be used to achieve the greatest things in life. Let effort be the luckiest thing in your life. Most people believe their success is dependent on the destiny factor. Truth is your hard work is the greatest luck you have. We can write our Future and defy destiny if we decide to achieve. All these learnings play a key role in exponential growth. Just don't try hard and go with what's happening while keeping all these in mind and you shall experience growth and results in no time. Keep thinking keep Creating. | PEC welcomed Mr. Bikram Singh Garewal the university’s oldest alum at Homecoming 2020: Global Alumni Meet.

Variety refers to different types of data velocity refers to high speed of data processing and volume refers to amount of data. Since data is exponentially increasing every second therefore need for analysis of data is imperative. The process of analysing data to find meaningful patterns is known as data analytics. She also explained data analytics using splunk which is a comprehensive tool to collect discrete machine data and provide an efficient way to analyse troubleshoot and investigate various incidents. She also explained one of the main use case of splunk: point of sale analytics. In her expert talk she also provided an overview of the concept and need for cloud computing and how it can help in big data analytics. She elaborated upon various cloud services like Saas Paas Iaas. Use of SaaS applications tends to reduce the cost of software ownership by removing the need for technical staff to manage install manage and upgrade software as well as reduce the cost of licensing software. PaaS is built on top of virtualization technology. Businesses can requisition resources as they need them scaling as demand grows rather than investing in hardware with redundant resources. IaaS is the most flexible cloud computing model and allows for automated deployment of servers processing power storage and networking. The speaker also gave a demo using Amazon Web Services which is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals companies and governments on a paid subscription basis. The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers available all the time through the Internet. The speaker concluded the expert talk by elaborating upon various challenges in big data analytics. Finally the lecture ended up with questionnaire session and discussion of students and speaker. | TOPIC OF SESSION 3: MOBLIES AND IOT A NATIONAL SECURITY PERSEPECTIVE | DATE: 6 March 2019 TIME: 10 AM-12 PM | The lecture was given by Suraj Narayanan from DBaux Bangalore on “Moblies and IoT a national security persepective”. He motivated the students that a lot can be done by a software engineer for the national security. For example- Implementing SewageTreatment at Solapur a smart city project for helping the nation. This can be done by placing IoT sensor devices to detect quality and quantity and avoiding the attacks like the case in which the excess chlorine was added in the water. Another project could be Writing software for movement of trucks of military. The major concern regarding this is THE STORAGE OF DATA as the major softwares communicators data storage locations are owned by USA. There is no way of controlling how data gets out of cyber space. We cannot give smart phones to “jawans” as there will be a risk of privacy breach. The practical example of this is Kargil war in which GPS was turned off by USA and we lost around 5000 soldiers. Similar case can be observed in JalliKattu Riots. All of these incidents conclude that we are secure physically but not from cyber space point of view. They can manipulate the data as they required commonly known as Information Warfare.The term means that mindset of the people can be changed based on the collected data. The real life example of this is Cambridge Analytica personalised adds to manipulate the perception of people. Few terms were introduced like CyberCommons CyberColony CyberColonial Power. Some of the achievements done by his company for nation include Seculink-Domain controller with patch management is provided to the defence of India to control whole network so that data remains within you Seculink UTMS AvrakOS- in this open source code of some OS is picked and that part is cleaned where the data goes out SecuMobile-specially designed for Indian defence with 100% owning of the software. He motivated the students to show their keen interests in this field for the nation’s security by joining the various startups and the guest also showed the interest in hiring the young and talented engineers in this area. | TOPIC OF SESSION 4: NEW SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RISING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SPACE SECTOR | DATE: 6 March 2019 TIME: 2-4 PM | The lecture was given by Mr. Ankit Bhateja Founder and director of Xovian Research and Technologies Pvt.

The speaker further explained types of patents i.e. design patents and utility patents. The speaker elucidated on important concerns like how to discover if your idea is new or not. The only way is to search the literature products of rival and prior companies and one can also use Google patent search according to the speaker. He answered questions like what exactly is a patent and what happens after you have filled it. He informed the audience that there are various help platforms available to file a patent. For instance if you want to file a patent in Australia a complete list of patent officials of Australia is given on their website. Total 5600 patents exist for individuals till date. But that’s for individuals for companies it is large in number. He stated that the whole beauty is that you have shared your idea and that the need is not to hide but to share. Only this will lead to innovation. The speaker cleared several myths and misconceptions related to patents and told that to file a patent in India one can visit www.ipindia.nic.in to get information on patents.
