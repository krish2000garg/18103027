Engagement of Classes: | All classes are to be held as per announced time-table. The time table of an individual faculty member must be displayed outside his/her room and also on the website (standard format available with Webmaster for uploading). No scheduled class should be left unengaged. If a class has to be rescheduled due to certain reasons it must be done with prior intimation to the HOD and the students about the alternate class. Even in emergencies (medical or otherwise) it is the responsibility of a faculty member to inform the HOD or his office by telephone/messenger of the re-scheduling of a class. This information must also reach the students. Normally a class should commence within 5 minutes of the starting time and should finish not earlier than 5 minutes before end time. Only in rare cases say once or twice a semester may a class be disengaged more than 5 minutes before the end-time. Tutorials and practical classes must also be engaged as scheduled. The students must be kept busy during the entire scheduled duration of the class. Classes are to be engaged for the entire semester. There is no provision for completing a course in lesser number of classes than those scheduled as per academic calendar. | B. Attendance: | The Attendance Register must be maintained properly. The attendance should be recorded in terms of progressive number of classes attended by a student. Absence in a particular class should be marked as ‘X’ (see the instructions printed in the register in this regard; other instructions given in the register may be treated as amended according to this document). The attendance status of all students must be announced and displayed outside the office of the course instructor at least thrice every semester – before first mid-term exam before 2nd mid term exam and before the end-term exam. The Attendance Register must be put up to the HOD of the instructor’s department on the first day of every mid-term examination as well as end-term examination for checking/ certification. Thereafter the register is to be kept in safe custody by the Course Instructor. | C. Monitoring: | 1. The HODs are to undertake regular monitoring of engagement of classes taking the help of faculty if required. 2. In case a class is found unengaged without intimation with regards to its rescheduling (i) it must be taken on record without exception by the HOD | (ii) the concerned course-instructor must be asked to explain the reasons in writing; | (iii) HODs are to issue suitable response/advice/admonition etc. as deemed appropriate in all cases in writing and report the same to the Director within a week. | 3. The Attendance Registers of all the faculty members of the Department must be checked at least twice during every semester – during the days of 1st mid-term & 2nd mid-term exams and once at the end of the semester. The Register is to be returned to the Course Instructor for safe custody. | 4. An Institute-level mechanism of monitoring coordinated by a Committee headed by a nominee of the Director will supplement the Departmental process. | Heads of the Departments should bring this to the notice of all concerned in their Departments (by circulation). | Copyright © 2020 Punjab Engineering College (Deemed to be University) Sector 12 Chandigarh 160012,,,Institute | Research | Academics | Facilities | Information,

Memorial Lecture on 5th March 2019. Prof. V. Ramgopal Rao Director IIT-Delhi Fellow IEEE FNAE FNA FASc and FNAScwas the guest speaker who gave an enlightening talk on “Bridging Academic R&D with Product Innovation: A Way Forward”. “If you do not question and take it as it is you will become a software engineer.”- Prof. Rao. The session motivated students to think of technical advancement in terms of entrepreneurship. Young engineers were prompted to rethink the way technology affects everyday lives and it’s exponential advancement. He defined engineering as the process of finding sustainable solutions to problems ranging from refining medical equipment to doubling farmers’ incomes. His major emphasis lied on the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to these issues and leverage technology to resolve these problems especially specialized branches of engineering like Nanotechnology. He pointed to the Institute of Nano Science and Technology (INST) Chandigarh as an example of a great research facility with some of the brightest minds. In terms of research output India is growing at 14% compared to the world average of 4% but the number of patents filed by Indian researchers is very low. This means we are generating a lot of knowledge but not translating it into tangible products. He urged the budding engineers in the room to aspire to develop new products and technology to solve the nation’s pressing issues. Citing examples from his own research in the field of nanotechnology he further explained the working of the novel ‘electronic nose platform for explosive detection’. While giving an overview of the product development process from identifying a problem statement developing prototypes testing them preparing contingency plans and implementing the final solution he gave an example of how they used piezoelectric sensors to tap into the vibrations of moving buses and trains and harvest that power to charge batteries. The speaker himself has collaboration with students and faculty across IIT Delhi and Bombay to develop cost-effective sensors in agriculture to detect soil health and optimize the output and highlighted the varied background of the people involved in the project from mechanical and electrical engineers to semiconductor experts. The session ended with a perceptive Q&A and allowed the audience to voice their concerns and clear their doubts regarding prototype development funding issues technological issues and resource allocation in research. The event was attended by the faculty and B.E. M.E. and PhD. students of Electrical Engineering Department at PEC. Mr. Arun Grover ex-Vice Chancellor of Punjab University and a representative of the late Professor Jagdish Kumar Arora’s family also graced the event.
